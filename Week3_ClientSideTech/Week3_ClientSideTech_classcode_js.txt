if({}) {} // True
if(0) {} // False

true && true = true
true && false = false
false && false == false
false && true = false

{} && true = true
true && {} = {}
if({}) {} = true
// Javascript: truthlike or falselike

{} && false = false
false && {} = false 

&& -- if the first operand is true, return the 2nd operand
        if the first operand is false, return the first operand

true || true = true
true || false = true
false || false = false
false || true = true

{} || [] = {}
[] || {} = []
{} || false = {}
1 || false = 1
false || -1 = -1
-1 || false = -1

// if the first operand is true, return the first operand
// if the first operand is false, return the second operand

0 || false = false

if({} || 1) {}

** undefined means TOTALLY nonexistent **
