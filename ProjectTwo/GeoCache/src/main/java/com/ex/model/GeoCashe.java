/**
 * @author that-team
 * This class defines a geocache location. An item can be placed into a geocache by a user and then
 * retrieved by other users. We anticipate that many items will be picked up and placed
 * into the world again, as is customary in the geocaching scene. We also anticipate that the same
 * geocache location will be reused, as is also customary.
 *
 * @param cacheID -  a unique, identifying number for the item, generated by the Database
 * @param itemID - the ID number for the item being placed into this geocache
 * @param imageurl - a picture of where the general area in which the geocache is located, uploaded by the user who places it,
 *              intended to assist other users when looking for it, this field contains a URL linking
 *              to the storage location
 * @param gpsLocation - JSON data including the longitude and latitude of the geocache's location
 * @param difficultyLevel - a ranking, set by the user who places the item. The difficulty ranking
 *                   will inform other users how hard it will be to find. It will also be used
 *                   so that a user may filter geocaches near them, and it will be used for users
 *                   to gain experience by finding the item or placing it.
