Shelter Web App
Barthelemy Martinon and Kira Herb

Our Project 1 consists of a mock animal shelter system where users can either search for details on different animals held in said shelter, be able to manipulate animal data, or be able to manipulate employee data.

While this system is still a bit rough and incomplete, it should function well enough to fall under the category of being a business applciation, revolving around database table manipulation and being set up on a container and servlets through Docker and Tomcat respectively.
