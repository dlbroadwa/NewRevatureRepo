Instructions on how to use Docker for this web application:

1. In the IntelliJ IDE, enter the following command into the IDE Terminal:

	docker build .

2. Open the Docker Quickstart Terminal (Should have been installed when installing Docker TOOLBOX) and enter the following commands:

	a. docker image ls
	   Look for a new image with the tag and repo fields set to <none>

	b. docker tag <image-id> shelterwebapp
	   The new image for the web application should be renamed for convience, enter the new image's Image ID value for <image-id>
	   When running docker image ls again, the new image should be named shelterwebapp

	c. docker run -d -p 80:8080 shelterwebapp
	   This will instantiate a new Docker container for the web app (based on the Dockerfile)

The container should now be available for interaction with the application. 
You'll need to find the "docker-machine ip" value in the Docker CLI to get an IP address (for instance, for me and possible everyone else, it should be 192.168.99.100).

Test to see if it works by taking a compatible browser (Edge and IE doesn't work right now, but GOOGLE CHROME does.) and typing in the URL:

http://192.168.99.100/shelterwebapp/
or
http://192.168.99.100:8080/shelterwebapp/ 
(if you set it to any other port instead of 8080, make sure to specify that in the URL)
